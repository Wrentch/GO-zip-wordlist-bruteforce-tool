# GO zip wordlist bruteforce tool
## Tool for bruteforcing encrypted zip files using a wordlist 
The title says it all, this is a simple cracking tool made in GO. Ive really been enjoying it and its really fun to play with. When you start the script/the cracker it will ask you 
for the zip file location and then the wordlist file location. I provided a test zip file and a small wordlist. The thing I am most proud of, I think, is its speed. It test (On my pc ofc(didnt try it on others), uncompiled) 1000 passwords per 10 sec inside the VSCode 
terminal and about 1000 passwords every 3 seconds in the windows native terminal which makes me really happy.

TO DO: See if a file is not encrypted
